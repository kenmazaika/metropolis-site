              We started Metropolis because the engineers we were working with were seeing the same problems that we were.  And we think we have a <mark>unique solution</mark> to the problem.

                <div class="text-dark mb-0">&ldquo;At any point in time, any part of our microservices architecture could be misconfigured, broken.  Possibly because someone pushed a testing branch to staging and they left it on staging. <br /><br />

This is frustrating, because an engineer who hasn't touch staging wants to use it, and then it doesn’t work right.  It has the downstream effect that we don’t notice until weeks or months.  Meanwhile our engineers are avoiding testing their work, and we're shipping a product that's buggy. Whenever we dig into it, <mark>it takes us hours to figure out why staging is broken</mark>.<br /><br />

That is a constant gripe of our entire engineering team.&rdquo;</div>

                When a system that a new engineer has never worked on  isn't working on staging, how can you expect them to figure out how to fix it?&rdquo;</div>
